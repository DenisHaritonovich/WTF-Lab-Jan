## Bugs & problems
| Priority | Severity | Description                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low      | Low      | Entry(Message) expands after adding children like time, event or favourite mark                    |
| Medium   | Major    | Horizontal list throws exceptions at present state (presumably conflict of column + listView pair) |
| Medium   | Low      | ThemeManager does not implement all colors (only primary + Brightness.dark overrides theme)        |
| Low      | Low      | SearchTextField does not change List View content while deleting text out of it                    |

## Roadmap
- Organize libraries (for easier project expansion)
- Create View and Logic for floatingButton at home screen (to create new category)
- Customise Drawer at HomePage
- Create layout for two other screens at HomePage (Timeline and Daily)
